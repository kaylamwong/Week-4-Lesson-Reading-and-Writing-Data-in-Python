However, this makes changes like parsing numbers from strings more inconvenient, so its probably better to leave it as a list.\n",

    "- The nested function parse_line is for convenience to avoid repeating the logic for stripping newlines and splitting on tabs. It does not access any variables from the surrounding scope, but itself is scoped so only code inside the with statement can access it.\n",
    "- The header variable is a list populated by parsing the first line of the file.\n",
    "- This function uses three built-in functions that we haven't mentioned before.\n",
    "    - The built-in function next returns the next output from an iterator. In this case, it was the first line from the file.\n",
    "    - The built-in function dict takes in an iterable of pairs (sequences of length two) and populates a dictionary. The first value of each pair becomes a key, and the second value of each pair is that key's value.\n",
    "    - The built-in function zip takes two or more iterables, repeatedly takes a value from each, and yields a tuple of those values. The name is an analogy to zipping up a zipper - two sides are becoming paired together. In this usage, the column names in the header variable are being paired with the values in the line variable.\n",
    "- This code will raise an exception when next is called if the file is empty\n",
    "    - This means that the file does not even have a header row, and your assumptions about this being a valid data file were wrong. If you catch this exception, you should probably report which file the error, and then raise an exception again since your process is unlikely to work with this file empty.\n",
    "- If rows after the header have different numbers of values, this code will continue without an exception, but you may be surprised later since the dictionaries are not as expected\n",
    "    - If there are fewer values than expected, then the code will implicitly assume that these values should be matched to the first column names in the header, and the dictionary will be missing the later keys. You will see the KeyError exception when trying to access those keys.\n",
    "    - If there are more values than expected, then they will be silently dropped by the zip function.\n",
    "    - If you want to catch these cases, you can add an explicit length comparison (len(header) != len(line)) and code your own response, or add strict=True to the zip call which will make it raise a ValueError if the lengths do not match."
